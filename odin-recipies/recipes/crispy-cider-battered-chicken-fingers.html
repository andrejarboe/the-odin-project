    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Believe it or not, the best beer batter isn't made with beer! It's actually done with sparkling apple cider,
        which produces a light, beautifully crispy, and very flavorful coating. Not to mention it's super easy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            4 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon kosher salt
        </li>
        <li>
            ¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            1 pinch cayenne pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
        </li>
        <li>
            1 cup self-rising flour
        </li>
        <li>
            1 ¼ cups sparkling apple cider
        </li>
        <li>
            1 quart canola oil for frying
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Mustard Dipping Sauce (Optional):</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            ⅓ cup Dijon mustard
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar
        </li>
        <li>
            1 teaspoon hot sauce
        </li>
        <li>
            1 pinch white sugar, or to taste
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Cut each chicken breast into 6 finger-sized strips, and transfer into a mixing bowl.
        </li>

        <li>
            Season with kosher salt, black pepper, and cayenne and toss until evenly coated. Sprinkle the all-purpose
            flour over top and shake the bowl to coat the strips. Toss until all the surfaces are completely coated, and
            then transfer onto a rack or plate. Place in the refrigerator, uncovered, for at least 10 minutes, or until
            ready to fry.
        </li>

        <li>
            Meanwhile, whisk self-rising flour and sparkling apple cider together in a mixing bowl to form a thin
            batter. Batter should be somewhere between a thin pancake batter and a crepe batter, but still thick enough
            to coat the back of a spoon. Place in the refrigerator to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before using.
        </li>

        <li>
            Mix Dijon mustard, vinegar, hot sauce, and sugar together for dipping sauce in a bowl.
        </li>

        <li>
            Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </li>

        <li>
            Dip each chicken finger into the batter to coat. Deep-fry in batches in the hot oil until golden brown,
            crispy, and no longer pink in the centers, 3 to 4 1/2 minutes. Drain on paper towels and serve immediately
            with dipping sauce.
        </li>
    </ol>
